## Overview

**precmed** was developed to help researchers with the implementation of
precision medicine in R. A key objective of precision medicine is to
determine the optimal treatment separately for each patient instead of
applying a common treatment to all patients. Personalizing treatment
decisions becomes particularly relevant when treatment response differs
across patients, or when patients have different preferences about
benefits and harms. This package offers statistical methods to develop
and validate prediction models for estimating individualized treatment
effects. These treatment effects are also known as the conditional
average treatment effects (CATEs) and describe how different subgroups
of patients respond to the same treatment. Presently, **precmed**
focuses on the personalization of two competitive treatments using
randomized data from a clinical trial (Zhao et al. 2013) or using
real-world data (RWD) from a non-randomized study (Yadlowsky et al.
2020).

## Installation

The `precmed` package can be installed from CRAN as follows:

``` r
install.packages("precmed")
```

The latest version can be installed from GitHub as follows:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "smartdata-analysis-and-statistics/precmed")

## Recommended workflow

We recommend the following workflow to develop a model for estimating
the CATE in order to identify treatment effect heterogeneity:

1.  Compare up to five modelling approaches (e.g., Poisson regression,
    boosting) for estimating the CATE using cross-validation through
    [catecv](https://smartdata-analysis-and-statistics.github.io/precmed/reference/catecv.html).
2.  Select the best modelling approach using 3 metrics:
    - Compare the steepness of the validation curves in the validation
      samples across methods using `plot()`. Two side-by-side plots are
      generated, visualizing the estimated average treatment effects in
      a series of nested subgroups. On the left side the curve is shown
      for the training set, and on the right side the curve is shown for
      the validation set. Each line in the plots represents one scoring
      method (e.g., boosting, randomForest) specified under the argument
      `score.method`.
    - The area between curves (ABC) using
      [abc](https://smartdata-analysis-and-statistics.github.io/precmed/reference/abc.html)
      quantifies a model’s ability to capture treatment effect
      heterogeneity. Higher ABC values are preferable as they indicate
      that more treatment effect heterogeneity is captured by the
      scoring method.
    - Compare the distribution of the estimated ATE across different
      levels of the CATE score percentiles using `boxplot()`.
3.  Apply the best modelling approach in the original data or in a new
    external dataset using `catefit()`.
4.  Optional. Use `atefit()` to estimate ATE between 2 treatment groups
    with a doubly robust estimator and estimate the variability of the
    ATE with a bootstrap approach.

In the vignettes, we will adopt a different workflow to gradually expose
the user from simple to more complex methods.

## User input

When applying `catefit()` or `catecv()`, the user has to (at least)
input:

- `response`: type of outcome/response (either `count` or `survival`)  
- `data`: a data frame with individual patient data  
- `score.method`: methods to estimate the CATE (e.g., `boosting`,
  `poisson`, `twoReg`, `contrastReg`)  
- `cate.model`: a formula describing the outcome model (e.g., outcome ~
  age + gender + previous_treatment)  
- `ps.model`: a formula describing the propensity score model to adjust
  for confounding (e.g., treatment ~ age + previous_treatment)
