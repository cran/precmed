#' Doubly robust estimator of and inference for the average treatment effect for
#' continuous data
#'
#' Doubly robust estimator of the average treatment effect between two
#' treatments, which is the rate ratio of treatment 1 over treatment 0 for
#' count outcomes. Bootstrap is used for inference.
#'
#' @param cate.model A formula describing the outcome model to be fitted.
#' The outcome must appear on the left-hand side.
#' @param ps.model A formula describing the propensity score model to be fitted.
#' The treatment must appear on the left-hand side. The treatment must be a
#' numeric vector coded as 0/1. If data are from a RCT, specify \code{ps.model}
#' as an intercept-only model.
#' @param data A data frame containing the variables in the outcome and
#' propensity score models; a data frame with \code{n} rows (1 row per
#' observation).
#' @param ps.method A character value for the method to estimate the propensity
#' score. Allowed values include one of: \code{'glm'} for logistic regression
#' with main effects only (default), or \code{'lasso'} for a logistic regression
#' with main effects and LASSO penalization on two-way interactions (added to
#' the model if interactions are not specified in \code{ps.model}). Relevant
#' only when \code{ps.model} has more than one variable.
#' @param minPS A numerical value between 0 and 1 below which estimated
#' propensity scores should be truncated. Default is \code{0.01}.
#' @param maxPS A numerical value between 0 and 1 above which estimated
#' propensity scores should be truncated. Must be strictly greater than
#' \code{minPS}. Default is \code{0.99}.
#' @param interactions A logical value indicating whether the outcome model
#' should be fitted separately by treatment arm with the variables in
#' \code{cate.model}, which is equivalent to assuming treatment-covariate
#' interaction by all of the variables in \code{cate.model}. If \code{TRUE}, the
#' outcome model will be fitted separately by treatment arms only if at least
#' 10 patients received each treatment option. Default is \code{TRUE}.
#' @param n.boot A numeric value indicating the number of bootstrap samples
#' used. Default is \code{500}.
#' @param verbose An integer value indicating whether intermediate progress
#' messages and histograms should be printed. \code{1} indicates messages are
#' printed and \code{0} otherwise. Default is \code{0}.
#' @param plot.boot A logical value indicating whether histograms of the
#' bootstrapped treatment effect estimates should be produced at every
#' \code{n.boot/10}-th iteration and whether the final histogram should be
#' outputted. Default is \code{FALSE}.
#' @param seed An optional integer specifying an initial randomization seed for
#' reproducibility. Default is \code{NULL}, corresponding to no seed.
#'
#' @return Return a list of 8 elements:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{\code{log.rate.ratio}: } A numeric value of the estimated log rate ratio.
#'   \item{\code{se.boot.log.rate.ratio}: } A numeric value of the bootstrap standard error of log rate ratio.
#'   \item{\code{rate.ratio}: } A numeric value of the estimated rate ratio.
#'   \item{\code{rate.ratio0}: } A numeric value of the estimated rate in the group trt=0.
#'   \item{\code{rate.ratio1}: } A numeric value of the estimated rate in the group trt=1.
#'   \item{\code{rate.ratio.CIl}: } A numeric value of the lower limit 95\% bootstrap confidence interval
#'     for estimated rate ratio.
#'   \item{\code{rate.ratio.CIu}: } A numeric value of the upper limit 95\% bootstrap confidence interval
#'     for estimated rate ratio.
#'   \item{\code{pvalue}: } A numeric value of the p-value derived from the bootstrapped values
#'     based on a Chi-squared distribution.
#'   \item{\code{warning}: } A warning message produced if the treatment variable was not coded as 0/1. The key
#'   to map the original coding of the variable to a 0/1 key is displayed in the warning to facilitate the
#'   interpretation of the remaining of the output.
#'   \item{\code{plot}: } If \code{plot.boot} is \code{TRUE}, a histogram displaying the distribution of the bootstrapped log rate ratios.
#'   The red vertical reference line in the histogram represents the estimated log rate ratio.
#' }
#'
#' @details This helper function estimates the average treatment effect (ATE) between two
#'  treatment groups in a given dataset specified by \code{y, trt, x.cate, x.ps, time}. The ATE is
#'  estimated with a doubly robust estimator that accounts for imbalances in covariate distributions
#'  between the two treatment groups with inverse probability treatment weighting.
#'  For count outcomes, the estimated ATE is the estimated
#'  rate ratio between treatment 1 versus treatment 0. Both original and log-transformed ATEs are
#'  returned, as well as the rate in either treatment group.
#'  If \code{inference = TRUE}, the variability of the estimated rate ratio is also calculated
#'  using bootstrap. Additional variability outputs include standard error of the log rate ratio,
#'  95\% confidence interval of the rate ratio, p-value, and a histogram of the log rate ratio.
