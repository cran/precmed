\usage{
data.preproc.mean(
  fun,
  cate.model,
  init.model,
  ps.model,
  data,
  prop.cutoff = NULL,
  prop.multi = NULL,
  ps.method,
  score.method = NULL,
  initial.predictor.method = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fun}{A function for which argument check is needed; "pm" for \code{catefitmean()}, "cv" for \code{catecvmean()},
and "drinf" for \code{drmean.inference()}. No default.}

\item{cate.model}{A formula describing the outcome model to be fitted.
The outcome must appear on the left-hand side.}

\item{init.model}{A formula describing the initial predictor model. The outcome must appear on the left-hand side.
It must be specified when \code{score.method = contrastReg} or \code{twoReg}.}

\item{ps.model}{A formula describing the propensity score model to be fitted.
The treatment must appear on the left-hand side. The treatment must be a numeric vector
coded as 0/1. If data are from a RCT, specify \code{ps.model} as an intercept-only model.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables in the outcome and propensity score models;
a data frame with \code{n} rows (1 row per observation).}

\item{prop.cutoff}{A vector of numerical values (in (0, 1]) specifying percentiles of the
estimated log CATE scores to define nested subgroups. Each element represents the cutoff to
separate observations in nested subgroups (below vs above cutoff).
The length of \code{prop.cutoff} is the number of nested subgroups.
An equally-spaced sequence of proportions ending with 1 is recommended.
Default is \code{seq(0.5, 1, length = 6)}.}

\item{prop.multi}{A vector of numerical values (in [0, 1]) specifying percentiles of the
estimated log CATE scores to define mutually exclusive subgroups.
It should start with 0, end with 1, and be of \code{length(prop.multi) > 2}.
Each element represents the cutoff to separate the observations into
\code{length(prop.multi) - 1} mutually exclusive subgroups.
Default is \code{c(0, 1/3, 2/3, 1)}.}

\item{ps.method}{A character value for the method to estimate the propensity score.
Allowed values include one of:
\code{'glm'} for logistic regression with main effects only (default), or
\code{'lasso'} for a logistic regression with main effects and LASSO penalization on
two-way interactions (added to the model if interactions are not specified in \code{ps.model}).
Relevant only when \code{ps.model} has more than one variable.}

\item{score.method}{A vector of one or multiple methods to estimate the CATE score.
Allowed values are: \code{'boosting'}, \code{'gaussian'}, \code{'twoReg'}, \code{'contrastReg'},
\code{'randomForest'}, \code{'gam'}.}

\item{initial.predictor.method}{A character vector for the method used to get initial
outcome predictions conditional on the covariates. Only applies when \code{score.method}
includes \code{'twoReg'} or \code{'contrastReg'}. Allowed values include one of
\code{'boosting'}, \code{'poisson'} (fast), and \code{'gam'}. Default is \code{NULL}, which assigns
\code{'boosting'} for count outcomes.}

           - x.ps: matrix of \code{p.ps} baseline covariates (plus intercept); dimension \code{n} by \code{p.ps + 1}
