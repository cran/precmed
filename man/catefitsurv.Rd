\description{
Provides singly robust and doubly robust estimation of CATE score for survival data with
up to 5 scoring methods among the following: Random forest, boosting, poisson regression,
two regressions, and contrast regression.
}
\details{
The CATE score represents an individual-level treatment effect for survival data,
estimated with random forest, boosting, Poisson regression, and the doubly
robust estimator (two regressions, Yadlowsky, 2020) applied separately by treatment group
or with the other doubly robust estimators (contrast regression, Yadlowsky, 2020) applied
to the entire data set.

\code{\link{catefitsurv}()} provides the coefficients of the CATE score for each scoring method requested
through \code{score.method}. Currently, contrast regression is the only method which allows
for inference of the CATE coefficients by providing standard errors of the coefficients.
The coefficients can be used to learn the effect size of each variable and predict the
CATE score for a new observation.

\code{\link{catefitsurv}()} also provides the predicted CATE score of each observation in the data set,
for each scoring method. The predictions allow ranking the observations from potentially
high responders to the treatment to potentially low or standard responders.

The estimated ATE among nested subgroups of high responders are also provided by scoring method.
Note that the ATEs in \code{\link{catefitsurv}()} are derived based on the CATE score which is estimated
using the same data sample. Therefore, overfitting may be an issue. \code{\link{catecvsurv}()} is more
suitable to inspect the estimated ATEs across scoring methods as it implements internal cross
validation to reduce optimism.
