\item{response}{A string describing the type of outcome in the data.
Allowed values include "count" (see \code{\link{catecvcount}()}), "survival"
(see \code{\link{catecvsurv}()}) and "continuous" (see
\code{\link{catecvmean}()}) .}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables in the outcome, propensity score, and inverse
probability of censoring models (if specified); a data frame with \code{n} rows (1 row per observation).}

\item{score.method}{A vector of one or multiple methods to estimate the CATE score.
Allowed values are: \code{'boosting'}, \code{'twoReg'}, \code{'contrastReg'}, \code{'poisson'} (count and survival outcomes only),
\code{'randomForest'} (survival, continuous outcomes only), \code{negBin} (count outcomes only), \code{'gam'} (continuous outcomes only),
\code{'gaussian'} (continuous outcomes only).}

\item{cate.model}{A formula describing the outcome model to be fitted.
The outcome must appear on the left-hand side. For survival outcomes, a
\code{Surv} object must be used to describe the outcome.}

\item{ps.model}{A formula describing the propensity score (PS) model to be fitted. The treatment must
appear on the left-hand side. The treatment must be a numeric vector coded as 0/1.
If data are from a randomized controlled trial, specify \code{ps.model = ~1} as an intercept-only model.}

\item{ps.method}{A character value for the method to estimate the propensity score.
Allowed values include one of:
\code{'glm'} for logistic regression with main effects only (default), or
\code{'lasso'} for a logistic regression with main effects and LASSO penalization on
two-way interactions (added to the model if interactions are not specified in \code{ps.model}).
Relevant only when \code{ps.model} has more than one variable.}

\item{init.model}{A formula describing the initial predictor model. The outcome must appear on the left-hand side.
It must be specified when \code{score.method = contrastReg} or \code{twoReg}.}

\item{initial.predictor.method}{A character vector for the method used to get initial
outcome predictions conditional on the covariates specified in \code{cate.model}. Only applies
when \code{score.method} includes \code{'twoReg'} or \code{'contrastReg'}. Allowed values include one of
\code{'randomForest'} (survival outcomes only), \code{'boosting'}, \code{'logistic'}
(survival outcomes only, fast), \code{'poisson'} (count outcomes only, fast), \code{'gaussian'} (continuous outcomes only) and
\code{'gam'} (count and continuous outcomes only). Default is \code{NULL}, which assigns \code{'boosting'}
for count outcomes and \code{'randomForest'} for survival outcomes.}

\item{ipcw.model}{A formula describing the inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW)
model to be fitted. The left-hand side must be empty. Only applies for survival outcomes.
Default is \code{NULL}, which corresponds to specifying the IPCW with the same covariates
as the outcome model \code{cate.model}, plus the treatment.}

survival outcomes. Default is \code{NULL}, which corresponds to setting the truncation time as the
maximum survival time in the data.}

lower (\code{FALSE}) values of the outcome are more desirable. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{prop.cutoff}{A vector of numerical values (in `(0, 1]`) specifying percentiles of the
estimated log CATE scores to define nested subgroups. Each element represents the cutoff to
separate observations in nested subgroups (below vs above cutoff).
The length of \code{prop.cutoff} is the number of nested subgroups.
An equally-spaced sequence of proportions ending with 1 is recommended.
Default is \code{seq(0.5, 1, length = 6)}.}

\item{prop.multi}{A vector of numerical values (in `[0, 1]`) specifying percentiles of the

searching for a balanced training-validation split. Default is \code{5,000}.}
